# Moke
Mouse from Keyboard

# Backstory

I purchased an XPS 13 9310, which is a laptop whose touchpad has no
separate physical mouse buttons. Clicking the touchpad is how you get
LeftButton. That's problematic because:

* It needs quite a forceful click, which is tiring and ...

* The pressure needed increases towards the edge of the touchpad, or
  isn't even possible. There's no visible clues on the trackpad that
  the useable area is less than its physical size.

* It's very hard to release the button without altering location --
  the number of times sized a window as I wanted it, and then have it
  change when releasing â˜¹

* During a drag, if you hit the edge of the touchpad, it's
  _impossible_ to resite your finger and continue dragging.

* To get MiddleButton & RightButton one has to enable multitouch,
  which is quite problematic.

All in all, not good. A clear indicator that I would not get on with
macbooks.

However, the keyboard has a 'windows' key, which I never use (it's
treated as LeftMeta in Linux, but still not used by me). That's
conveniently situated just above the touchpad, so why not use that as
LeftButton?  I can't just use the similarly convenient Left- and
RightAlt for the other two mouse buttons, as Alt itself is needed.
But Windows+LeftAlt and Windows+RightAlt seem a useful combination.

Remapping those keys using the keymap wouldn't quite work.  I needed
to separate different Alt and Ctrl keys, and UIs would still think the
Alt or Ctrl was pressed when using them in a chord.  Plus I ended up
using RightCtrl as a non-modifier mouse key, which is orthogonal to
its use as a regular modifier key.

Hence Moke. This reads from the keyboard device and generates mouse
button events on a created user input device that is found by the X
server.

# Example

I have the following in my .zlogin:
```shell
moke &
```

Because Moke's defaults work for me (funny heh?), that finds the
laptop's keyboard and creates a Moke device, which is subsequently
picked up when the X server starts. This use requires moke to be
installed setuid, see below.

# Usage
```shell
moke [OPTIONS] [KEYBOAD]
```

KEYBOARD is either a pathname or a partial string match of the
keyboard device name. As this can be ambiguous as to which is which,
and the following heuristic is used. If KEYBOARD begins with `/` or
`./`, it is a pathname. If it contains a space, it is a partial
string.  Otherwise an attempt is made to open it and if that fails it
is treated as a partial name.

File opening is relative to `/dev/input`.

For find-by name, the `/dev/input` directory is scanned looking for
exactly one EVIO keyboard device that matches the partial name.  The
partial name can be anchored to the start of a device name with `^`,
and anchored to the end with `$` -- but it is _not_ a regexp.  Use `^`
and `$` to force an exact match.

# Defaults

The default keyboard match is ` keyboard$`, which as explained above
anchors a case-insensitive test to the end of the keyboard's name.
All my laptops report a keyboard named `AT Translated Set 2 keyboard`,
and the final word is sufficiently unique.

The default mapping I use is:

* Windows -> LeftButton
* Windows+LeftAlt -> MiddleButton
* RightCtrl+RightAlt -> MiddleButton
* RightCtrl -> RightMouse

This means the RightCtrl key is not otherwise useable -- but I remap
the CapsLock key to Ctrl functionality.<a href="#1"><sup>1</sup></a>
The chords needed for MiddleButton can be done with one hand --
leaving the other to operate the touchpad itself.

# SetUid

Both the `/dev/uinput` device and `/dev/input` directory are not
useable by non-root users. Thus you either need to run `moke` under
`sudo`, or as setuid. For the latter you must configure with
`-DMOKE_SETUID=1` and then either install as root, or do a bit of
manual alteration after installing. It's either that or some sudo
fiddling or repetitive password typing.

When moke detects it is running with elevated privileges, it drops
them as soon as possible.

<a name="1">1</a>: _Where it always should be._ Why do we still have
CapsLock anyway?
